## Introduction: My name is Jalyssa De La Torre, I am in 10th grade, and coding is honestly so cool to see how it works but I don't like coding especially from scratch.

## Summer Playlist: Some songs that I listened to over the summer is Super Rich Kids by Frank Ocean, See You Again by Tyler, the Creator, and I Bet On Losing Dogs by Mitski.

## Favorite Summer Food: The food the I ate the most during summer was teriyaki chicken, rice, and veggies from my favorite food placed called Hungry Ninja.

## Favorite Summer Memory With Friends: My favorite summer memory that I made with friends was when me and my friends had a pool party at my house the day before school and I invited a lot of my friends that I didn't get to see all summer. It was a really fun experience and all the boys decided to learn how to backflip but most ended up belly flopping.

## Sports and Physical Activities: A sport that I took part in over this summer was cross country, we ran about 2.5 miles every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
